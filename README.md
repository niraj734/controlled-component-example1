# React Controlled Input Example
A controlled component is any component whose behavior or rendered output is fully driven by React state, making state the single source of truth.

This is a simple example of a **controlled component** in React.  
The input value is stored in state and updates live as you type.

### How it works:
1. Input value comes from state (`text`).
2. State updates via `onChange`.
3. React is the source of truth — this is the **controlled component pattern**.

4. ##React controlled component means that component is managed by its state and its ui is dependent upon its state this can be either stateful or stateless
stateful means whcih needs to remener the previous state to update the current state
