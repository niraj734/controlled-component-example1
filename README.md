# React Controlled Input Example

This is a simple example of a **controlled component** in React.  
The input value is stored in state and updates live as you type.

### How it works:
1. Input value comes from state (`text`).
2. State updates via `onChange`.
3. React is the source of truth — this is the **controlled component pattern**.
